## Objectives

Using RMI, write an application for a prototype opinion poll system:
<li>Assume that only one issue is being polled.</li>
<li>Respondents may choose yes, or no.</li>
<li>A client-server application to accept the votes, keep the tally (in memory), and provide the current counts to those who are interested.</li>
