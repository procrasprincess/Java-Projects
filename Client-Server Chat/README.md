## Objectives

Write two programs to chat. Each program is playing the role of a client (`MyClient.java`) or a server (`MyServer.java`).

The programs should work as following:
- Run `MyServer.java`. The program is waiting for the client. After the client is connected the server program send: `Hello !!`.
- Run `MyClient.java`. This program receives the message: `Hello !!`.
- The following steps are repeated until the client enters: `Bye`.


The following steps are repeated until the client enters: `Bye`.
  - Step 1: Enter a message on the client’s console (for example, `How are you, server?`)
    - This same message should appear on the server’s console side.
  - Step 2) Enter a message on the server’s console (for example, `I am good. Do you have any question, client?`).
    - This same message should appear on the client’s console side.
- These two steps should be repeated until the client enters: `Bye`.
