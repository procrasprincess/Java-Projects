## Objectives

Write client-server classes to calculate π:
- Have a number of clients.
- The server creates a thread for each client.
- Each client calculates the estimated value of π and sends to the server.
- The server takes an average of these values and displays a more precise value of π.  
- Your server should work for any number of clients by just changing the value of the constant identifier: size.
